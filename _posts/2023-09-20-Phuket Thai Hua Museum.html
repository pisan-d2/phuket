<h2 class="section-heading">Fact</h2>

<p>Located on Thanon Krabi, in the Talat Nuea subdistrict, the Museum was opened in 1934 and consists of a two-storey Sino-Portuguese building which originally served the purpose of a school offering classes in Hokkien Chinese, the first and only of its kind in the province. The lower floors are currently used for exhibitions related to the lifestyles and history of Hokkien Chinese migrants in Phuket and visitors can find out about their unique customs, beliefs, and traditions here, as well as their relationship with the Phuket locals. For large group visits contacting the museum in advance is recommended</p>
