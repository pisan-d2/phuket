<h2 class="section-heading">Fact</h2>

<p>Comprising of the Thanon Klang, Thanon Dibuk, Thanon Phang Nga, Thanon Yaowarat, Thanon Krabi and Soi Romanee roads, 
    the area is steeped in history and in bygone days was inhabited by settlers from many different nations and ethnic groups, 
    including Chinese, Indians, Europeans and Muslims who came to trade or put down their roots.</p>

    <p>These early settlers built terraced homes in a style that later became known as ‘Sino-Portuguese’ architecture. 
        Way back in the reign of King Rama IV, the tin mining industry flourished but these days the mines are preserved as museums 
        and many local buildings have been converted into accommodation, dining spaces, coffee shops and souvenir shops. 
        There is also a large market and walking street which is organized every Sunday between 16.00 and 22.00 hrs. 
        along Thalang Road to give visitors the chance to sample the multicultural charms of the old town.</p>
