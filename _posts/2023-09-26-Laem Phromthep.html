<h2 class="section-heading">Fact</h2>

<p>This breathtaking sunset viewing spot is located in southern Phuket and famous for its now iconic lighthouse, which casts light beams that can be seen up to 39km out to sea. There is an exhibition housed inside which details the origins and the construction process which led to the lighthouseâ€™s fruition and a display showing the sunrise and sunset times as well as the standardized time for Thailand. Restaurants, coffee shops and souvenir stalls can be found dotted around the cape and there is a paved pathway which leads down to the spot where views of nearby Ko Kaeo Phitsdan and Ya Nui beach await.</p>
