<h2 class="section-heading">Fact</h2>

<p>This pier is situated amidst a community of local seafaring people who trawl and fish for their livelihood, and you will find a line of both fishing boats and ferries moored close to the shore most of the time. These local boats are used to ferry Island hopping tourists around the local islands like Ko Lon, Ko He, Ko Bon, Ko Racha and Ko Kaeo Phitsadan for reasonable rental fees. The Beach itself is lined with resorts, beach huts and simple restaurants offering ultra fresh seafood.</p>
