<p>Located in front of the Nak Koet Buddhist Park, this Buddha image, in the attitude of subduing Mara, is a stunning piece of contemporary art which measures in at 25.45 meters wide and 45 meters in height. The image is made from reinforced concrete and covered in white and jade ‘Suriyakanta’ marble, imported from neighboring Myanmar and weighing in at a massive 135 tonnes. The image was named by three venerable and highly revered monks: Somdet Prayansangwon, Somdet Prasankarach and Sakolmahasangparinayayok in 2007 and designated as a dharma site which also affords great views over Chalong Bay from the front face of the image and of Kata, Karon and other smaller bays to the rear.</p>
