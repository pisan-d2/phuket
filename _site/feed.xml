<p>Comprising of the Thanon Klang, Thanon Dibuk, Thanon Phang Nga, Thanon Yaowarat, Thanon Krabi and Soi Romanee roads, 
    the area is steeped in history and in bygone days was inhabited by settlers from many different nations and ethnic groups, 
    including Chinese, Indians, Europeans and Muslims who came to trade or put down their roots.</p>

    <p>These early settlers built terraced homes in a style that later became known as ‘Sino-Portuguese’ architecture. 
        Way back in the reign of King Rama IV, the tin mining industry flourished but these days the mines are preserved as museums 
        and many local buildings have been converted into accommodation, dining spaces, coffee shops and souvenir shops. 
        There is also a large market and walking street which is organized every Sunday between 16.00 and 22.00 hrs. 
        along Thalang Road to give visitors the chance to sample the multicultural charms of the old town.</p>

<p>This property stands on Thanon Krabi in the Talat Nuea subdistrict and was built towards the end of King Rama IV’s reign. It is widely believed to be the first example of Sino-Portuguese architecture in the whole of the Phuket province. The distinguishing features of the two-storey house are the ornate front door, decorated with golden Chinese characters and distinctive colored glass windowpanes. There is a small pond located in the airy, open central courtyard area, imported Italian tiles on the floor, an ornate wooden staircase and many household fixtures and decorations from China. In fact, almost everything in the house is imported, a fact made possible Phuket was once a trading route for ships on their way between Penang, Malaysia and Europe.</p>
